<!-- short-description -->

**An Obsidian plugin for ultra-simple automated flashcard syncing from a folder in your vault to Anki. Pure Markdown syntax. Minimal configuration. No fuss.**

<!-- /short-description -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Yanki Obsidian plugin is feature-complete but will remain zero-versioned until it's been thoroughly tested. Please Exercise caution and make backups of your Vault and Anki notes until the 1.0.0 release.
>
> The plugin currently available for download and installation directly from GitHub for advanced users. It will be submitted for review and potential inclusion as an Obsidian community plugin once I am completely confident in its design and reliability. _(Expected circa July 1, 2024.)_
>
> Any testing and feedback by adventurous users is extremely welcome.

## Overview

The Yanki plugin automatically syncs a folder (or folders) of notes from your Obsidian vault to Anki.

The primary novelty of its approach is in how Markdown is translated into Anki notes. The **structure** of a Markdown note determines the **type** of Anki note it becomes, so no extra syntax or Anki-specific markup is required — just pure Markdown.

This also means that your flashcard notes remain nice and legible in Obsidian, and you don't have to deal with the cognitive switch of \`\`\`\`\` fenced regions and Anki's templating syntax.

## FAQ

### Why do I have to come up with a title for every card

Use Rey Christian's [Auto Filename](https://github.com/rcsaquino/obsidian-auto-filename) plugin.

### Seeing the `noteId` property everywhere is annoying

Hide it with a [CSS snippet](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets):

```css
div.metadata-property[data-property-key='noteId'] {
  display: none;
}
```
